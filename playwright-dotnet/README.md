## Running your tests

- To run a single test, run `dotnet run single`

https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json
- Run `dotnet run sessiondetails` to check how to get session details.

  ### Run sample test on privately hosted websites

    **Using Command-line Interface**
    1. You have to download the BrowserStack Local binary from the links below (depending on your environment):
        * [OS X (10.7 and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-darwin-x64.zip)
        * [Linux 32-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-ia32.zip)
        * [Linux 64-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-x64.zip)
        * [Windows (XP and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-win32.zip)
    2. Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you can initiate the binary by running the command: `./BrowserStackLocal --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`
    3. Once you see the terminal say "[SUCCESS]" You can now access your local server(s) in our remote browser‚Äù, your local testing connection is considered established.
    4. You can then run the sample Local test using `dotnet run local`

Understand how many parallel sessions you need by using our [Parallel Test Calculator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/parallel-calculator?ref=github)
