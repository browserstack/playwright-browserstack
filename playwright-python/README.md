![BrowserStack Logo](https://d98b8t1nnulk5.cloudfront.net/production/images/layout/logo-header.png?1469004780)

## Setup

* Clone the repo and run `cd playwright-python`
* Make sure you have Python 3 (version < 3.9.0) installed on your system
* Install Playwright
  ```
  pip install --upgrade pip 
  pip install playwright
  playwright install
  ```

## Running your tests

- To run a single test, run `python single-playwright-test.py`
- To run parallel tests, run `python parallel-playwright-test.py`

  ### Run sample test on privately hosted websites

  1. You have to download the BrowserStack Local binary from the links below (depending on your environment):
      * [OS X (10.7 and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-darwin-x64.zip)
      * [Linux 32-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-ia32.zip)
      * [Linux 64-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-x64.zip)
      * [Windows (XP and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-win32.zip)
  2. Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you can initiate the binary by running the command: `./BrowserStackLocal --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`
  3. Once you see the terminal say "[SUCCESS]" You can now access your local server(s) in our remote browser”, your local testing connection is considered established.
  4. You can then run the sample Local test using `python parallel-playwright-tests.py`

Understand how many parallel sessions you need by using our [Parallel Test Calculator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/parallel-calculator?ref=github)
