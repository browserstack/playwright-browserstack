## Setup

* Clone the repo and run `cd playwright-java`

## Running your tests

- To run a single test, run 
  `mvn -Dexec.mainClass="com.browserstack.PlaywrightSingleTest" -Dexec.classpathScope=test test-compile exec:java
`
- To run parallel tests, run 
  `mvn -Dexec.mainClass="com.browserstack.PlaywrightParallelTest" -Dexec.classpathScope=test test-compile exec:java
`

  ### Run sample test on privately hosted websites

  **Using Language Bindings**
    1. Run 
    `mvn -Dexec.mainClass="com.browserstack.PlaywrightLocalUsingBindingsTest" -Dexec.classpathScope=test test-compile exec:java`

  **Using Command-line Interface**

  1. You have to download the BrowserStack Local binary from the links below (depending on your environment):
      * [OS X (10.7 and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-darwin-x64.zip)
      * [Linux 32-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-ia32.zip)
      * [Linux 64-bit](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-x64.zip)
      * [Windows (XP and above)](https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-win32.zip)
  2. Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you can initiate the binary by running the command: `./BrowserStackLocal --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`
  3. Once you see the terminal say "[SUCCESS]" You can now access your local server(s) in our remote browser‚Äù, your local testing connection is considered established.
  4. You can then run the sample Local test using 
    `mvn -Dexec.mainClass="com.browserstack.PlaywrightLocalTest" -Dexec.classpathScope=test test-compile exec:java`

Understand how many parallel sessions you need by using our [Parallel Test Calculator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/parallel-calculator?ref=github)
